This README documents the steps necessary to run the Library Books visualization.The title of our visualization is ÒLibrary CheckoutsÓ. We are a team of four MS-HCI students, including Kelsie Belan, Isabel Newsome, Taylor Stillman, and Darsh Thakkar. We used Javascript to code our visualization, and it runs on the Chrome web browser. This repository contains all the code required to run the visualization.### How do I Run the Visualization? ### * To begin:Open your terminal in the folder library_trends.  Run the following command.   > $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080   Then in your Chrome browser open http://localhost:8080/scatterplot_begins/ and you are good to go!
